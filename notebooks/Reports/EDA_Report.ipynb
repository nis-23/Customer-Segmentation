    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents the findings of our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset with the objective of gaining insights and preparing the data for further analysis. The analysis highlighted key observations and actionable steps to improve data quality and inform strategic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Transformation of Transaction Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1 `avg_transaction_value` Creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon examining the dataset, it was observed that `total_trans_count` (total transaction count) and `total_trans_amount` (total transaction amount) exhibited a high positive correlation. To mitigate multicollinearity, a new variable, `avg_transaction_value`, was derived as the ratio of `total_trans_amount` to `total_trans_count`. However, this new variable displayed a left-skewed distribution. To address this skewness, a log transformation was applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Step:** Continue using the log-transformed `avg_transaction_value` for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Months on Book (MOB) Categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Categorization of `months_on_book`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the scatterplot for `months_on_book` revealed an intriguing pattern. Data points were evenly distributed on both sides of the median value, suggesting that `months_on_book` could function as a categorical feature with two categories: \"MOB > 3 Years\" and \"MOB < 3 Years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Step:** Create a binary feature based on the categorization of `months_on_book` to differentiate customers by loyalty levels for tailored strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Gender Labeling for K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1 Transformation of Gender Column:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate K-Means Clustering, the \"gender\" column was transformed from \"M\" and \"F\" labels to numerical values \"1\" and \"0,\" respectively. This numerical representation enables the exploration of gender-related patterns within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Step:** Utilize the numerical gender representation for clustering analysis and gender-specific insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Ordinal Categorization of Education Level\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1 Transformation of `education_level`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"education_level\" column was converted into an ordinal categorical variable based on a predefined mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Step:** Leverage the ordinal representation of education level for exploring relationships between education and other dataset variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Simplification of Marital Status\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.1 Marital Status Simplification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that a significant portion of the \"marital_status\" column was attributed to categories like \"single,\" \"divorced,\" and \"unknown,\" it was simplified by creating a binary feature indicating whether an individual is married or not. This simplification streamlines the analysis and focuses on the distinction between married and non-married individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Step:** Incorporate the simplified marital status variable into analysis and strategy development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Categorization of Other Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Other variables were categorized based on values that approximately divided the data into two parts. This categorization aids in segmentation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Removal of `total_relationship_count`\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis revealed that the `total_relationship_count` variable, representing the number of customer-company interactions, lacked crucial contextual information regarding the timeframe and purpose of interactions. Consequently, it provided limited insights into customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Step:** Exclude the `total_relationship_count` variable from further analysis.\n",
    "\n"
